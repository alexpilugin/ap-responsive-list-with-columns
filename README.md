# AP Solution

We have a three-column list. The list items are ordered horizontally, in alphabetical order, like this:

|--------------|------------|-----------|    
| Apple	     | Banana    | Cheese  |     
| Didgeridoo | Eggs  	| Fanta     |     

What we would like to see is the list items ordered vertically, like this:

|-----------|--------------|----------|     
| Apple	 | Cheese       | Eggs     |     
| Banana  | Didgeridoo | Fanta    |     


Try to solve the problem using CSS.    
Do not change the HTML.     
It needs to look reasonable in Edge, Firefox and Chrome, with a pragmatic fallback for older browsers.     
The solution needs to cope with a shorter list, maybe just two items.     
The solution needs to handle a smaller screen width.     
Also provide a solution which uses JavaScript to help solve the problem.
